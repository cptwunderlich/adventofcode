# Advent of Code 2021

As per usual, I won't compete for the leaderboards.
I'm just trying to solve the puzzles for fun, if I have enough time.
This year I'll try to solve them using C++, really trying to use a more "functional"
style, e.g., using standard lib algorithms.

## Build and run

The provided Makefiles assume a GCC version that supports C++17.
To build, just run `make`.

To run:

`cat input | ./aoc`
