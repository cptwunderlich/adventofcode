# Advent of Code 2018

At it again! I don't have any hard and fast rules, but I'm trying to either use a language
I don't know well, or at least to solve the problem in a somewhat efficient matter.

## Day 1

Thanks to this being a Saturday, I had plenty of time. Solved it in Haskell, which I barely
know, that's why it took forever.

## Day 2

Much like day 1. Again in Haskell, slightly better, but still feels alien.

## Day 3

I had a really long day and was very tired when I attempted this one.
Went straight to Python3, because I didn't have the time or energy for Haskell.
Originally, I didn't want to solve it with a huge array, but use an efficient
scan-line/sweep-line algorithm.

I didn't finish that and rewrote it quickly to an ugly, slow hack on the morning
of day 4.

Makes me feel a little defeated. Would be interesting, to implement a proper 2D
scan-line algorithm sometime.

## Day 4

Again in the evening and again Python3, but this one went much better.
I did think about a more efficient way to store the time intervals, but in the end
I kept it simple.

## Day 5
